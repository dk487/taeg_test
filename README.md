# Test TAEG

Your colleague began to write his implementation for an APR calculator (TAEG). Now he is ill and you have to finish his work.

Some info regarding the business domain you can find here:

-  Italian: https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indice_sintetico_di_costo
-  English: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annual_percentage_rate

Please keep in mind:

-  TAN is the nominal interest rate,
-  TAE is the annual percentage rate of charge (APR), and
-  TAEG is the effective APR (or EAPR). 

## TODO

1. Run `composer install` in the directory.
2. Run `phpunit` right after it.
3. Implement the methods so that these tests can pass.
4. Refact the code a bit because our server runs with PHP 7.0 installed.
5. Share your Git repository (at Bitbucket or Github) with the recruiter.
